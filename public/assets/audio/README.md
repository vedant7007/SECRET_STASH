## Placeholder Audio

Until real audio is ready, the system will:
- Use sine wave tones at different frequencies per scene
- Show visual indicators when audio would trigger
- Log audio events to console for debugging

## Integration Notes

All audio is managed by `/src/core/AudioManager.ts`:
- Preloading during calibration
- Crossfading between scenes (3.5s default)
- Spatial positioning for whispers
- Volume curves synced with animations
