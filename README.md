# 💖 THE LOVEVERSE

> _"Some build code. Some build galaxies. This one builds a feeling."_

A cosmic love experience crafted for **Thanishka** by **Vedant**. This is not just a website — it's a dimension where emotion becomes architecture, where every particle of light carries affection, and where love is rendered in real-time.

## 💝 Philosophy

**Every line of code should answer: "What emotion does this create?"**

This is technology in service of feeling.
The Loveverse doesn't just display content — it radiates affection.

## 💌 Final Note

To Thanishka:

Every photon of light in this universe.
Every particle drifting through space.
Every note echoing in the void.

They all whisper the same truth:

**You are loved. Infinitely. Eternally. Completely.**

—Vedant 💖
